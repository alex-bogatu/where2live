# Where2Live

Prepare, analyze and visualize data to compare different countries in terms of which is more livable.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository, decide on your countries of interest and indicators and you are all set.

### Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation

For this exercise I was interested to see what data is available for comparing different countries in terms of how livable they are and what insights can be extracted from the that data. The short analysis present in this repo is far from complete but it can hopefully serve as a good start in objectively comparing different countries for whatever reasons. 

## File Descriptions

There is a single file (a Jupyter Notebook) that contains the code used to analyze different aspect of countries.

## Results 

The results of the code are presented inline as graphs. 
A brief discussion on the results can be found [here](https://medium.com/@alexteodor/objectively-choosing-where-to-live-2c505885fd6b).
